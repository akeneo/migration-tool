  introduction:
    title: |
       This tool aims to help you to migrate your PIM 1.7 standard edition (either Community or Enterprise) to the new version 2.0.
       All your data will be migrated seamlessly. Your source PIM won't be updated nor touched. Instead, we'll perform the migration in a brand new PIM 2.0.
    rules: |
       In what follows, "source PIM" will refer to your current 1.7 PIM whereas "destination PIM" will refer to your future 2.0 PIM.
       Moreover, you need to install a PIM 2.0 on your computer to let us fill it with your data.

    You success to migrate all your data in the new PIM ! You may want to look at the
    logs in "var/logs" folder if there are some errors. If you have any custom code you should
    have a look at the "UPGRADE-2.0.md" file, availaible at the root of Transporteo.
